# SOAN 395: Senior Seminar in Quantitative Analysis 
### This project explores cycling connectivity and mobiity through Paris, France: here, Mayor Anne Hidalgo has implemented a stronger bike-friendly policy framework since taking office in 2014. This project uses 2014 and 2021 as case comparison years to examine the spread of the bike lanes across Paris, questioning if Paris's investment in a more expansive cycling network disproportionally advantaged higher income areas' connectivity compared to their lower income counterparts. If so, what is the difference in connectivity, measured by distance to lanes and cycling lane density over time and space? 


#### Updates and Notes:
##### Below are the R and .csv files created and used to produce my regressions and findings.  
##### I am working on producing a codebook, which outlines all original sourcing of French demographic data and geospatial bike lane data.
